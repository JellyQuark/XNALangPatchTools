# XNALangPatchTools
A tool chain for developing language patchs for XNA applications

```XNBFontRawDataProcessingTool```: Tool for processing raw data (```font.texture.png``` and ```font.yaml```). Can be used to edit / merge multiple data into one automatically

```xnb_node.0.2.2```: A modified version of xnb node for processing large character set.

I have used this tool chain to develop a Chinese patch for Superfighters Deluxe.
